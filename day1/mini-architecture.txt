GCP Mini Architecture: Component Interaction

2. Components Created:
- VPC Network (custom)
   demo-vpc-day2' with subnet 'subnet-central' (10.0.1.0/24)
   Used to isolate and control network traffic

- VM Instance (EC2 Equivalent) 
    Created in a custom subnet inside the VPC
    Could be running a web server, app, or CLI tools
    Connected to the internet via default route or NAT

- Cloud Storage Bucket
    Named: 'day1-bucket-demo'
    Used for storing data
    demo.txt file was uploaded via the gcloud CLI


2. Architecture Overview:

               +----------------------------+
               |  Cloud Storage Bucket      |
               |     day1-bucket-demo       |
               +-------------^--------------+
                             |
                  +----------+----------+
                  |   VM Instance        |
                  |     demo-instance     |   
                  +----------^----------+
                             |
                  +----------+----------+
                  |  Custom VPC          |
                  |  10.0.1.0/24         |
                  +----------------------+

3. Description:
- The VM (demo-vm) is deployed inside the custom VPC, within a defined subnet (10.0.1.0/24).
- The custom VPC ensures isolated and controlled network communication.
- The VM accesses the Cloud Storage bucket using GCPâ€™s internal API to read or serve static content (e.g., web files or data).
- Firewall rules allow traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) to reach the VM from external sources if configured.
- The custom subnet supports future scaling with more VMs, private IP control, and additional security layers.

4. Purpose:
This mini architecture demonstrates basic compute, storage, and networking setup in GCP, ideal for small web applications or backend services.
